This repository contains the course projects of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning". It contains two folders one for **COCO**(Cross Connection) **PUF**(Physical Unclonable Device) and other for **Bigram Word Predictor**. 

1. The accuracy for COCO-PUF obtained was **99.4%**, thereby highlighting the vulnerability of mathematical attack
2. The precision for Biagram word predictor was **0.78** with a model size of 301726 nodes using the decision tree classifier
